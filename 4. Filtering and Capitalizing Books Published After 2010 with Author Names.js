// 4. Filtering and Capitalizing: Books Published After 2010 with Author Names.
// Write a program that takes a list of books, including their authors and publication years as input. The program
// should then filter out all books that were published before 2010 and create a new array with the remaining
// books, but with their author names capitalized.

// List of books
